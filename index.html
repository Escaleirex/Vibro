                        Yeah<br>
                        Shawty, I know what you need<br>
                        I got everything you need<br>
                        I promise I ain't gonna hold out neither<br>
                        I'ma give it all to you baby<br>
                        It's burnin' on, bust it<br>
                        <br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        I know what you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        As long as you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        I know what you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        As long as you want, you know I got it<br>
                        <br>
                        We been together for a few years, shared a few tears<br>
                        Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear<br>
                        I'm always on the road, hardly ever home<br>
                        Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone<br>
                        I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated<br>
                        Ya patience gettin' short, how much longer can you tolerate it<br>
                        Listen ma I'm just motivated, I do this for us<br>
                        Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now<br>
                        <br>
                        Hey yo to really be honest<br>
                        You stuck with me through my whole struggle<br>
                        Can't even express through words<br>
                        How much the kid loves ya<br>
                        I'ma stand as a man, never above ya<br>
                        I can tell that you different from most<br>
                        Slightly approach you<br>
                        And the ill shit about it?<br>
                        We don't sex every day<br>
                        But when we sex, we tease<br>
                        In a passionate way<br>
                        I love the way you touch it<br>
                        Those little elaborate ways<br>
                        Got the God feelin' released<br>
                        To relax for the day<br>
                        It's on you ma<br>
                        <br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        I know what you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        As long as you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        I know what you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        As long as you want, you know I got it<br>
                        <br>
                        Shh, mami listen<br>
                        I feel ya love for me baby<br>
                        And how it move through you<br>
                        I been longin' for the moment<br>
                        To talk the truth to you<br>
                        (Listen) I'm never home<br>
                        I always get up and go<br>
                        Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole<br>
                        I never meant to put a thousand pounds<br>
                        Of stress on ya head<br>
                        I love the way we sleep<br>
                        And how we always cuddle in bed<br>
                        Baby, I stay embracin' ya patience<br>
                        Sheddin' ya tears with me<br>
                        I ask you my mami<br>
                        Please continue to bear with me<br>
                        <br>
                        We started out broke<br>
                        Constantly on a roll<br>
                        Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old<br>
                        Went from looseys and buses to 50 cent sodas<br>
                        And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers<br>
                        Mad years passed<br>
                        Still got each other back (Oh yeah)<br>
                        Word is bond, never screw none of these industry cats (Boy)<br>
                        We like Scull and Mulder<br>
                        Walkin' shoulder to shoulder<br>
                        Milkin' this game, watchin' our seeds gettin' older<br>
                        <br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        I know what you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        As long as you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        I know what you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        As long as you want, you know I got it<br>
                        <br>
                        Yes you know I'll die for you<br>
                        And you know I'll ride with you<br>
                        I will always try with you<br>
                        And give ya my love and cry with you<br>
                        I will climb a mountain high<br>
                        Until I was up to touch the sky<br>
                        So baby come and get more close to me (Mariah)<br>
                        'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be<br>
                        <br>
                        I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini<br>
                        It's been a few months in PA you haven't seen me<br>
                        Ya lookin' good in that Gucci bikini<br>
                        38 carats, ya ring lookin' freezy<br>
                        No matter what I do in the world, you never leave me<br>
                        Fall back ma, I'll make ya lifestyle easy<br>
                        I appreciate the things you do to please me<br>
                        Lookin' at my daughter, you'll never do me greasy<br>
                        <br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        I know what you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        As long as you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        I know what you want, you know I got it<br>
                        Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you<br>
                        As long as you want, you know I got it<br>
                        <br>
